From GPT, Houdini to Unreal: One-click AI-based Terrain Generation

This project implements an AI-assisted procedural asset pipeline that generates complete terrains and environment setups in Unreal Engine with a single operation. By combining GPT-driven natural language parameter extraction, Houdini procedural generation, and Unreal Engine integration, the system enables creators to produce rich 3D environments in minutes instead of hours.
🌍 AI-Assisted Terrain Generation

An end-to-end pipeline for one-click terrain generation using GPT, Houdini, and Unreal Engine.
Users can describe environments in natural language, and the system automatically creates fully playable terrains with erosion, material layers, and scattered vegetation.

🎮 Overview

AI-Assisted Terrain Generation is a procedural content pipeline that connects natural language input with game-ready environments.

GPT interprets user descriptions into structured parameters.

Houdini generates terrains, erosion layers, and vegetation scattering.

Unreal Engine 5.3 imports the results automatically, producing a ready-to-play scene in minutes.

“From a single sentence to a complete world — one click transforms your ideas into interactive 3D landscapes.”

🧩 Core Features

Natural Language to Parameters

Enter a plain description (“grassy valley with a river and pine forest”) → structured JSON parameters.

Procedural Generation in Houdini

Terrain heightfield with erosion simulation.

Automatic material layering (grass, soil, rock).

Vegetation and rock scattering with randomized transforms.

Seamless Unreal Integration

Landscape layers imported and auto-bound.

Instanced foliage & props placed correctly.

Fully playable maps in seconds to minutes.

Performance Gains

Small terrain: ~30s

Large terrain (1km × 1km): ~6 min (vs ~3h manually)

⌨️ Usage

Open Unreal Engine and launch the Editor Utility Widget.

Enter a natural language description of the scene.

GPT generates structured parameters (JSON).

Houdini creates terrain and scattering automatically.

Assets are imported back into Unreal → ready to play.

🛠️ Tech Stack

ChatGPT-3.5 → Natural language to procedural parameters

Houdini 20.5 → Procedural asset generation
